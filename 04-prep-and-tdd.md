### *Answer the question*
- Q1 :
1) Fosters the creation of optimized code.

2) Helps developers better analyze and understand client requirements and request clarity when they are not adequately defined.

3) The addition and testing of new functionalities become much easier in the latter stages of development.

- Q2 : When you have to do something repeatedly for many tests for example, initialize a function.

- Q3 : slow process – If you begin TDD, you’ll get the sensation that you simply need an extended duration of   
your time for straightforward implementations. you would like to believe the interfaces, write the test code, 
and run the tests before you’ll finally start writing the code.

- Q4 : ES6 classes is like a container that holds the constructor and the methods associated with your 
instantiated object.

- Q5 : This abbreviation stands for Representational (provide a view) State (state of a page may 
change) Transfer (transferring of data). When using an app programming interface, a 
user needs to make an HTTP inquiry (request) to interact with a web service.

### *sql vs nosql*
 SQL vs NoSQL: High-Level Differences:
- SQL databases are primarily called as Relational Databases (RDBMS); whereas NoSQL database are primarily 
called as non-relational or distributed database.
- SQL databases are table based databases whereas NoSQL databases are document based.
- SQL databases have predefined schema whereas NoSQL databases have dynamic schema for unstructured data.
- SQL databases are vertically scalable whereas the NoSQL databases are horizontally scalable.
- SQL databases uses SQL ( structured query language ) for defining and manipulating the data, which is very 
powerful. In NoSQL database, queries are focused on collection of documents.
- SQL database examples: MySql, Oracle, Sqlite, Postgres and MS-SQL. NoSQL database examples: MongoDB, 
BigTable, Redis, RavenDb, Cassandra, Hbase, Neo4j and CouchDb.
- For complex queries: SQL databases are good fit for the complex query intensive environment whereas NoSQL 
databases are not good fit for complex queries. 

SQL Database Examples:
- MySQL Community Edition
- MS-SQL Server Express Edition
- Oracle Express Edition

NoSQL Database Examples:
- MongoDB
- CouchDB
- Redis

### *sql modeling techniques*

When working with SQL databases it is often useful to create diagrams of the database tables and their 
relationships.  These may be done during the design process, as  your data modeling, or once the database is 
created, in order to document the tables’ dependencies.  As I explain various concepts in my lessons, I’ll 
sometimes use models to illustrate my points.

There are many types of modeling software you can use to create models, such as MySql Workbench, which not only 
create smart looking diagrams, but also generate the code to create the database.
