### *5 steps to RBAC*
- RBAC is the idea of assigning system access to users based on their role within an organization. The system 
needs of a given workforce are analyzed, with users grouped into roles based on common job responsibilities and 
system access needs.
- Benefits of RBAC: the assignment of access rights becomes systematic and repeatable. Further, it is much easier 
to audit user rights, and to correct any issues identified.

- 1- Inventory your systems.
- 2- Analyze your workforce and create roles.
- 3- Assign people to roles.
- 4- Never make one-off changes
- 5- Audit

### *wiki - RBAC*
role-based access control (RBAC) or role-based security: is an approach to restricting system access to authorized 
users. It is an approach to implement mandatory access control (MAC) or discretionary access control (DAC).
- Three primary rules are defined for RBAC:
- 1- Role assignment: A subject can exercise a permission only if the subject has selected or been assigned a role.
- 2- Role authorization: A subject's active role must be authorized for the subject. With rule 1 above, this rule 
ensures that users can take on only roles for which they are authorized.
- 3- Permission authorization: A subject can exercise a permission only if the permission is authorized for the 
subject's active role. With rules 1 and 2, this rule ensures that users can exercise only permissions for which 
they are authorized.
