# Read10 :Stacks & Queues

- A Stack is a linear data structure. that consists of Nodes. Each Node references 
the next Node in the stack, but does not reference its previous.

- The operations that can be performed on the stack:
1. push(x): It is an operation in which the elements are inserted at the top of the 
stack. In the push function, we need to pass an element which we want to insert in 
a stack. 
2. pop(): It is an operation in which the elements are deleted from the top of the 
stack. In the pop() function, we do not have to pass any argument.
3. peek()/top(): This function returns the value of the topmost element available 
in the stack. Like pop(), it returns the value of the topmost element but does not 
remove that element from the stack.
4. isEmpty(): If the stack is empty, then this function will return a true value or 
else it will return a false value.
5. isFull(): If the stack is full, then this function will return a true value or 
else it will return a false value.

- A Queue is a linear data structure. It is an ordered list that follows the 
principle FIFO (First In -First Out). A Queue is a structure that follows some 
restrictions on insertion and deletion
- FIFO (First In -First Out) :This means that the first item added in the stack 
will be the last item popped out of the stack.
- LIFO (Last In First Out) :This means that the last item added to the stack will 
be the first item popped out of the stack.

- the stack and queue:
1. Linear data structure
Both the stack and queue are the linear data structure, which means that the 
elements are stored sequentially and accessed in a single run.
2. Flexible in size
Both the stack and queue are flexible in size, which means they can grow and shrink 
according to the requirements at the run-time.
