### *AWS EC2*

- Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) provides scalable computing capacity in the Amazon Web Services (AWS) Cloud. Using Amazon EC2 
eliminates your need to invest in hardware up front, so you can develop and deploy applications faster. You can use Amazon EC2 to launch as many 
or as few virtual servers as you need, configure security and networking, and manage storage. Amazon EC2 enables you to scale up or down to handle 
changes in requirements or spikes in popularity, reducing your need to forecast traffic.

- Cloud computing is the on-demand delivery of IT resources over the Internet with pay-as-you-go pricing. Instead of buying, owning, and maintaining physical data centers and servers, you can access technology services, such as computing power, storage, and databases, on an as-needed basis from a cloud provider like Amazon Web Services (AWS).

-  Amazon EC2 provides the following features:
1. Virtual computing environments, known as instances.
2. Preconfigured templates for your instances, known as Amazon Machine Images (AMIs), that package the bits you need for your server (including 
the operating system and additional software)
3. Various configurations of CPU, memory, storage, and networking capacity for your instances, known as instance types.
4. Storage volumes for temporary data that's deleted when you stop, hibernate, or terminate your instance, known as instance store volumes.
5. A firewall that enables you to specify the protocols, ports, and source IP ranges that can reach your instances using security groups.
6. Static IPv4 addresses for dynamic cloud computing, known as Elastic IP addresses.
7. Metadata, known as tags, that you can create and assign to your Amazon EC2 resources.

### *EC2 For Humans*
- AWS EC2 is one of the most important services AWS offers. Getting started with it can be simple and hard at the same time.
- AWS (Amazon Web Service) is a cloud computing platform that enables users to access on demand computing services like database storage, virtual 
cloud server, etc. This online course will give an in-depth knowledge on EC2 instance as well as useful strategy on how to build and modify 
instance for your own applications.

### *Elastic Beanstalk*
- AWS Elastic Beanstalk is an easy-to-use service for deploying and scaling web applications and services developed with Java, .NET, PHP, Node.js, 
Python, Ruby, and Docker on familiar servers such as Apache HTTP Server, Apache Tomcat, Nginx, Passenger, and IIS. You can simply upload your code 
and Elastic Beanstalk automatically handles the deployment, from capacity provisioning, load balancing, auto-scaling to application health 
monitoring.
